# Modeling and Simulating Opinion Dynamics in Social Networks

In this report, we focus on the simulation of three main classes of complex network models: random graphs, small world models and scale-free models with the intention of applying these models as the foundational social networks for the simulation of discrete opinion dynamics models. Ultimately, these simulations and experiments will pave way for the next stage of our project where we explore the applications of opinion dynamics model in Financial Technology (FinTech) related fields. 

This report is organized as follows: 
- **Section 1** introduces the background of this project, including the concept of opinion dynamics and our preliminary ideas regarding the potential applications of opinion dynamics in FinTech. In addition, we will introduce our goals for this project. 
- **Section 2** provides a literature review of the existing studies on opinion dynamics models.
- **Section 3** introduces the aforementioned three classes of complex network models and our simulation process. 
- **Section 4** introduces the simulation of discrete opinion dynamics models (hereafter opinion dynamics model will solely refer to discrete opinion dynamics model as this is the focus of this project) and the results of our simulations. 
- **Section 5** discusses the future extension of our simulations and the next step for this project.
